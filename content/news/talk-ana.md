We'd like to invite you to attend a public talk by Anastassia Vybornova from the IT University of Copenhagen on the topic of 'Mathematics in the Ghetto': pitfalls (and potentials) of computational approaches to urban segregation, that will happen on December 4th at the Faculty of Science.

Anastassia Vybornova (she/her) is a PhD student in Urban Data Science at IT University of Copenhagen. Her work is centered around geospatial data and applications, socioeconomic inequalities, and sustainable mobility.

## "Mathematics in the Ghetto": pitfalls (and potentials) of computational approaches to urban segregation

In an increasingly data-driven world where inequalities and polarization are on the rise, what role can computational approaches play for urban segregation? In this talk, we will explore this question based on two ongoing research projects and several ideas-in-the-making. Looking at several contemporary examples of how Big Data -- and the assumptions underlying its usage -- influence (de)segregation patterns and policies, we ask: "How did we get to this?" We then trace back the history of segregation research and its ideological interdependence with prevalent economic theories and public discourse, highlighting the inherently political nature of corresponding mathematical models. Our overarching aim (work in progress!) is to develop a better discernment of the pitfalls (and potentials) of computational approaches to urban segregation.
