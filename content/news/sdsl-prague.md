The US CUNI team, together with the Map and Data Centre of the Faculty of Science, organised a second Spatial Data Science across Languages (SDSL) workshop with more than 25 participants on-site and about the same number online.

The SDSL workshop aims to bridge the gap between the programming languages used in data science for geographical applications and bring these communities together to discuss their differences and similarities and to find ways to discuss, collaborate and synchronise efforts.

This year's workshop continued the discussion started a year ago at the University of MÃ¼nster and attracted key developers from more than 20 countries in Europe and the USA. We hope to continue next year at the University of Salzburg.
