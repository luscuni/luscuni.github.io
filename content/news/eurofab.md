We are pleased to announce that a research consortium led by Dr Martin Fleischmann has
been awarded a grant to study the structure of cities in Europe in space and time.
The project, funded by the European Space Agency, will be
carried out in collaboration with academic partners from [The Alan Turing
Institute](https://turing.ac.uk), led by prof. Dani Arribas-Bel, and the [OECD
Geospatial Lab](https://www.oecd.org/regional/regional-statistics/geospatial-lab.htm),
led by Dr Claudia Baranzelli, and with partners from policy ([The Prague Institute of
Planning and Development](https://iprpraha.cz/en/)) and practice
([4ct](https://4ct.eu)).

During the 12 months of the project, the team will develop the the methodological basis
for the development of a continental scale urban fabric classification that can be
unfolded in time using artificial intelligence applied to Sentinel 2 satellite imagery.
See the project annotation in the [projects](../../projects) for more details.

The total value of the funding is â‚¬250,000.
